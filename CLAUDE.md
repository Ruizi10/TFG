### Analysis Summary

I couldn't find any direct matches for "dashboard" or related terms in the codebase. It's possible that the dashboard functionality is referred to by a different name, or it might be implemented in a way that isn't immediately obvious from a keyword search.

To help me understand what you're looking for, could you please clarify:

1.  **What kind of information or functionality do you expect from this "dashboard"?** (e.g., system metrics, user activity, project progress, data visualization).
2.  **Do you know any specific files or directories that might be related to the dashboard?**
3.  **Are there any specific terms or keywords that might be used in the codebase to refer to this dashboard functionality?**

With more context, I can perform a more targeted search.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Current Search Limitations**
   The research report indicates that no direct matches for "dashboard" were found in the codebase. This suggests that the functionality might be named differently or implemented in a non-obvious way. To proceed, more context is needed regarding the expected information or functionality of the dashboard, potential related files or directories, or alternative keywords that might be used in the codebase.
